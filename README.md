ðŸ“„ Job Scraper App

This project is a simple web application built using Flask that scrapes job listings based on a keyword and location from Indeed.com, and stores the results as JSON files on the local system. The front end is built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, while the back end handles scraping logic and file I/O.
