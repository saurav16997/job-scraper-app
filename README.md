ðŸ“„ Job Scraper App

This project is a web application built using FastAPI that scrapes job listings based on a keyword and location directly from the company career portal, and stores the results as JSON files on the local system. The front end is built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, while the back end handles scraping logic and file I/O.
In this Ive used companies like Amazon, Google and meta. We can add as many companies as we wnt by changing the link from the backend files.
